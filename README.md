# WeatherApp
A Weather App to display weather information according to user's current location

Tools & Technologies Used:
- Written in Kotlin
- MVVM Architecture
- Use of Flow for Interaction between Repository/Model & ViewModel layer
- MVI Pattern for handling UI states using sealed classes
- Dagger2 Dependency Injection for application and activity components (Retrofit, Room, etc)
- Additionally includes Room database which I used to practice 1-1 relationship between three tables to store data along with usage of foreign key
